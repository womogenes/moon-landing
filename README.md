# Moon Landing

A semi-realistic game where you try to land a rocket on the moon based on my limited understanding of orbital mechanics.

## Notes

- The moon's radius is only 20 kilometers in the game, but it's closer to 17,000 kilometers in real life.
- Consequently, the moon is only 10<sup>16</sup> kilograms in-game but it's really closer to 10<sup>23</sup> kilograms.
